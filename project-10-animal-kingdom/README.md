# Project 10: Animal Kingdom

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 10 for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to 
introduce students to advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through a series of labs that build 
towards a complex Animal Kingdom management system.

## Main Project: Lab Exercises
- Lab 1: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py) - Introduce basic OOP concepts by creating a base class for an animal and derived 
  classes for specific types of animals in an animal kingdom program.
- Lab 2: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py) - Extend the Animal Kingdom program from Lab 1 to include polymorphism, 
  demonstrating method overriding in derived classes.
- Lab 3: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py) - Build a Zoo class to manage a collection of animals from the Animal Kingdom 
  program, demonstrating managing objects and class interactions.

## Extension Task
As an extension task, students are invited to develop a fully fledged zoo management application 
based on the Animal and Zoo classes. This application should allow users to add, update, remove, feed, and 
other such methods on all animals. The development should include a menu-driven interface and proper input 
validation to ensure robustness.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and apply fundamental and advanced concepts of object-oriented programming in Python.
- Develop the ability to encapsulate data and functionality within classes effectively.
- Gain practical experience in using classes and objects to solve problems and implement complex systems.
