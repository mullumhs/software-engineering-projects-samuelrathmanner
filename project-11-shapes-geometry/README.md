# Project 11: Shapes and Geometry

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository hosts the Shape & Geometry project for our class, aimed at developing students' skills in advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Through this project, students will create a system that allows users to manage and interact with various geometric shapes.

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: This file contains the user interface and system integration logic. It handles user input and coordinates the interaction between the user and the system.
- **`shapes.py`**: Here, students will define the Shape base class along with derived classes such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

## Development Phases
### Requirements / Specifications
Students will start by identifying the user requirements and specifications based on the project brief provided by Wade. This phase involves understanding what functionalities the system must have and how these functionalities will be implemented technically.

### Design
In the design phase, students will conceptualize the class structure necessary for the project. They will create a base class called `Shape` and extend it with several derived classes, each representing a different geometric shape. The focus will be on applying OOP principles such as generalization, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Development
During the development phase, students will write the actual code for both `main.py` and `shapes.py`. `main.py` will manage user interactions, while `shapes.py` will include the implementation of the Shape classes and their methods. Students will apply the OOP principles discussed in class to build a modular and maintainable system.

### Testing and Debugging
Testing involves writing test cases that ensure each part of the program works as expected. Students will perform unit testing for individual classes and methods in `shapes.py` and system testing to ensure that the entire application functions correctly when components interact in `main.py`.

### Maintenance
Maintenance focuses on ensuring the program remains understandable and manageable. Students are encouraged to use best practices such as making regular commits with clear messages, commenting their code effectively, and using descriptive names for classes, methods, and attributes.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master fundamental and advanced OOP concepts in Python.
- Effectively encapsulate data within classes.
- Design, implement, and maintain a complex software system using Python.
