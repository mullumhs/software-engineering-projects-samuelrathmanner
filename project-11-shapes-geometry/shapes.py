Description:
Define the Shape base class along with derived classes such as
Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle using OOP principles like
inheritance and polymorphism.

Your classes should implement:
- A base Shape class with common attributes and methods
- Derived classes for specific shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle)
- Methods for calculating area and perimeter
- Polymorphism through method overriding

# Define your derived shape classes here (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc.)
