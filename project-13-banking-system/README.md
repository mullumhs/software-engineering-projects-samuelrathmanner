# Project 13: Banking System

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository hosts the Banking System project for our class, aimed at developing students' skills in object-oriented programming (OOP) with a focus on encapsulation and the facade pattern. Through this project, students will create a system that manages banking operations such as account creation, money transfers, and transaction logs.

## Project Structure
- **`account.py`**: This file should contain the Account class and derived classes with encapsulated attributes and methods for account operations like deposit and withdrawal.
- **`bank.py`**: Here, you should implement the BankManager class, which acts as a facade managing all interactions with the Account objects.
- **`main.py`**: This is the main program file that will provide a user interface for interacting with the BankManager class.

## Development Phases
### Requirements / Specifications
Students will start by listening to the client's needs and defining both what the software must do (requirements) and how it will do it (specifications). This phase involves detailed planning and preparation of how to implement OOP features effectively.

### Design
In the design phase, students will create a UML Class Diagram to visualise the relationships and interactions between classes, ensuring that all OOP principles such as encapsulation and the facade pattern are correctly represented.

### Development
During the development phase, students will write the code for `account.py`, `bank.py`, and `main.py`. Each file will adhere to the principles of OOP to create a well-structured and functional banking system.

### Testing and Debugging
Testing involves students writing test cases for both individual units and subsystems within the project to ensure all components work correctly both independently and when integrated.

### Maintenance
Maintenance will focus on keeping the code understandable and functional over time. This includes best practices like regular commits, effective code commenting, and the use of clear, descriptive names for classes, methods, and attributes.

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastering encapsulation and the facade pattern in OOP.
- Developing a comprehensive understanding of designing, implementing, and maintaining a banking system.
- Learning to plan, test, and debug complex software systems using Python.
