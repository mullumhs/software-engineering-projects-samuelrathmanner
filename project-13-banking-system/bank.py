Banking System - Bank Manager (Facade)
--------------------------------------
File Name: bank.py
Teacher: David Steedman
Class: Software Engineering

Description:
Implement the BankManager class, which acts as a facade managing
all interactions with the Account objects. External code should
interact only with BankManager, not directly with Account objects.

Your BankManager class should:
- Manage a collection of accounts
- Provide methods for creating accounts
- Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
- Maintain transaction logs
- Implement the facade pattern
"""

# from account import Account, SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount

# Define your BankManager class here
