**Teacher:** David Steedman

This repository contains the PWA Assessment Task for the MHS Software Engineering class. This is your main assessment task for the HSC Programming for the Web module.

## Overview

You are required to develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that demonstrates your understanding of web development concepts covered throughout the course. Your application should be built using Flask, SQLite, and HTML/CSS, incorporating modern web technologies for PWA functionality.
