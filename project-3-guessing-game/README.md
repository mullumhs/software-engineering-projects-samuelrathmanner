# Project 3: Guessing Game

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 3 and the corresponding labs for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to deepen the understanding of loops in Python, including `while` and `for` loops, as well as loop control mechanisms such as `break` and `continue`.

## Main Project: Guessing Game
- File: [`guessing-game.py`](guessing-game.py)
- Description: Create a guessing game that utilises loops and input validation in Python.

## Labs

### Lab 1: While Loops
- File: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py)
- Description: Create and use `while` loops in Python.

### Lab 2: For Loops
- File: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py)
- Description: Create and use `for` loops in Python.

### Lab 3: Input Validation
- File: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py)
- Description: Learn how to use loops and selection to validate user input.

### Lab 4: Random
- File: [`lab4.py`](lab4.py)
- Description: Learn how to generate random numbers in Python.

## Expected Output

### Guessing Game (Example Runs)

**Successful Game:**
```
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 37
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 31
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 4 attempts!
```

**Input Validation:**
```
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

Enter your guess: abc
Invalid input. Please enter a number.

Enter your guess: 150
Please enter a number between 1 and 100.

Enter your guess: 42
Too low! Try again.
```
