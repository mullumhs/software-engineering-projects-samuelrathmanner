# Project 5: To-Do List

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 5 and its corresponding labs for the MHS Software Engineering class. This project focuses on creating a To-Do List application in Python, which allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Students will learn about list manipulation, including adding, removing, sorting, and searching items within a list.

## Main Project: To-Do List
- File: [`to-do-list.py`](to-do-list.py)
- Description: Develop a To-Do List application in Python that allows users to manage their tasks. The application should enable users to add new tasks, remove completed tasks, sort tasks, and search for specific tasks.

## Labs

### Lab 1: Lists
- File: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py)
- Description: Learn how to create and manipulate lists in Python.

### Lab 2: Advanced List Features
- File: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py)
- Description: Delve into more advanced features of lists, such as removing items, searching within a list, and sorting.

### Lab 3: Errors
- File: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py)
- Description: Learn how to identify and fix different types of errors in Python.
