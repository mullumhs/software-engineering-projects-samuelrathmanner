# Project 9: Contacts (OOP)

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 9 for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to introduce students to object-oriented programming (OOP) through a series of labs that build towards a simple Contact Management system.

## Main Project: Lab Exercises
- Lab 1: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py) - Introduce basic OOP concepts by creating and manipulating Car objects.
- Lab 2: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py) - Establish a foundational Contact class with essential attributes for a contact management system.
- Lab 3: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py) - Enhance the Contact class with instance and class methods to extend its functionality.
- Lab 4: [`lab4.py`](lab4.py) - Implement the ContactManager class and use it to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Extension Task
- File: [`contacts.py`](contacts.py) (Optional)
- Description: As an extension task, students are invited to develop a fully fledged contacts application based on the Contact and ContactManager classes. This application should allow users to add, update, delete, search for, and list all contacts. The development should include a menu-driven interface and proper input validation to ensure robustness.

## Other Files
- File: [`contact_manager.py`](contact_manager.py) - Contains the ContactManager class with methods for managing Contact instances. This class is central to Lab 4 and the optional contacts application.

## Task Requirements
- The primary labs should be completed using Python, adhering closely to OOP principles.
- For the extension task, students should ensure the contacts application is menu-driven and handles user interactions gracefully.
- Both the labs and the extension application should incorporate proper input validation to handle unexpected user input effectively.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand and apply fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Python.
- Develop the ability to encapsulate data and functionality within classes effectively.
- Gain practical experience in using classes and objects to solve problems and implement systems.
- Extend theoretical knowledge into a practical, user-driven application through the optional contacts application development.
